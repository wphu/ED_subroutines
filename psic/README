smpsi.f  ->  Example main program demonstrating calls to the subroutines.
physput.f -> Subroutine for physical sputtering.
chmsput.f -> Subroutine for chemical sputtering.
ressput.f -> Subroutine for radiation enhanced sublimation.
bshevi.f  -> Subroutine for backscattering coefficients.
thermev.f -> Subroutine for thermal evaporation.
heatdif.f -> Subroutine for heat diffusion.

Note: It will be nice to rewrite these programs in a object oriented way
      which will reuse the various repeated constructs and will also
      provide a insight into the physical processes. This has not been
      done in these set of subroutines. The excuse being that these
      subroutines were written at different times for addressing
      different problems and therefore dont reuse parts.
